# Disease-Forecasting-A-COVID-19-Case-Study

Background : This year, Coronavirus has dominated the news, affecting everyone's lives one way or another.
So I decided to take an intitiative and study the effects of the virus,what measures we can take to 
minimize infections and 

Daily Cases

Collected the data for the daily new cases for the first six months,splitting it into 4 lockdown periods.
For each lockdown the number of new confirmed cases is higher at the end of lockdown as compared to the begining of Lockdown . 
Even after 4 Lockdowns the number of cases have increased significantly. This might be due to increased testing of People. So question is, was Lockdown successful ?. The answer to this question will be different for each person . One might think that government has done good job with its limited amount of Resources and situation could be worse if there was no Lockdown. 
Others might think that government should have taken action early in the month of February and could have handled the situation better like South Korea, or New Zealand who shut down all kinds of re-entry into their counttries at the right time.
The number of daily deaths is increasing significantly over the months. Currently the number of deaths are increasing with 350+ daily . One thing to notice about above graph is on 17 th June , India has reported 2003 Deaths. I wonder whats the reason behind the number of deaths to be high on that particular day.
Inference: As the number of daily new cases has increased so as the number of recovered cases . On 26 th June India had the most recovered cases over these months.

Gender and Age - Distribution

Upon close inspection of the patient data (pulled from Kaggle), I make the following observations
   1.  Of the 168148 patients in the database, 95694 of them had missing entries in the age-bracket column, so I obviously removed them.
       Patients from the age-bracket 28-32 had the highest number of confirmed cases since they tend to move out more.However, patients in the age group 57-67 had a higher fraction of deceased patients, suggesting that they are more vulnerable to the virus and their safety is of utmost priority.
   2.  Of the 168148 patients in the database, 96417 of the entries had no records of any gender.Upon discarding them,
       It was found that Males(66.5%) are more likely to contract the virus than males (33.5%)
   3.  Maximum transmissions were local, which means that community transmission has begun and India has moved on to stage 4.


StateWise Analysis

On inspecting the spread of the virus state-wise, I make the following observations : 

1. Maharashtra has the most no of cases by a large margin accounting for over 21% of the cases, along with a mortality rate of 3% (the highest) and a 
recovery rate of 72% which is good but not that impressive compared to other states.

2. Delhi has the highest recovery rate of almost 89%.

3. Gujarat accounts for roughly 2.6% of Covid Cases in the country but still has the highest mortality rate of 3.11% surpassing Maharashtra. Safety measure need to be prioritized here.

4. Andhra which is the second most infected state has a mortality rate under 1% proving to be the most efficient state during the lockdown.
